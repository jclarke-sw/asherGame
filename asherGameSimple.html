Hello Asher!!  Welcome to the first stage of building a Plants VS Zombies EXE game!

This file is written using the HTML language. Here's more info on HTML - https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
If this was a console game, the HTML file is like the TV, & the Javascript file is like the console that  makes the game happen.

In HTML, information is written between tags.
Each has an opening section with attributes, a middle section with the value, and a closing section.
The opening tag says what this section is, and the attributes explain what it looks like or what it does.
The closing section is pretty boring, and just says that the section is complete.

There are special tags called comments.  This is a comment! 
It starts with a <!-- tag, which tells the computer to ignore this line, and that it only has information for human readers.
It's like whispering, so that Alexa doesn't get confused.  It's a useful way to put explanations in your code for humans.

For example, in the code below you'll see <h1 id="Header">The Asher Games Dot EXE</h1>
The opening section is marked with <h1 id="Header">, and has the attributes id="Header".  h1 just means it's a level 1 heading.
The id attribute doesn't mean much at the moment, but it's useful to recognise that it's there.
</h1> just tells the computer to realise that the level 1 heading section is finished.

To change the behaviour of the game, change this file.
To chang how you see the game, change the HTML file.

<html lang="en">
<!-- So,  <html lang="en">  just tells the computer that we are using HTML language in English. -->
<head>
	<!-- HTML files are made up of 2 main parts, the head & the body.  This is the head part.
    This just tells the computer the background info on how to read the file.
    Try reading the begining sections of each tag to see what it does! -->

	<title>The Asher Game Dot EXE</title>

	canvas {
	    border:1px solid #d3d3d3;
	    background-color: #f1f1f1;
	}
	</style>
</head>
<!-- So that's the background information done.  Now we get to the body tag.  This is the part of the page that you can see -->
<body onload="startGame()">
	<!-- That attribute above tells the page to load the startGame function over in the Javascript file -->
	<script src="asherGameSimpleScript.js"></script>
	<!-- That line tells the HTML file that there is a javascript file that it should go and load up -->
	<br><br>
	<!-- <br> just means line break, or make a new line -->
	<!-- Here are the buttons that load the functions to start or stop the sunflower moving -->
		<button style="width:300px;" onmousedown="moveup()" onmouseup="clearmove()" ontouchstart="moveup()">UP</button><br><br>
		<button style="width:150px;" onmousedown="moveleft()" onmouseup="clearmove()" ontouchstart="moveleft()">LEFT</button>
		<button style="width:150px;" onmousedown="moveright()" onmouseup="clearmove()" ontouchstart="moveright()">RIGHT</button><br><br>
		<button style="width:300px;" onmousedown="movedown()" onmouseup="clearmove()" ontouchstart="movedown()">DOWN</button>
